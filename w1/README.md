# **Accuracy & Precision**

### **Task:** 
Obtain the machine accuracy of “float”
and “double” of your computer in two ways.

- Method 1: Use the routine **machar()** in NR in C
- Method 2: Use your own code, **get_eps()**, which is
based on finding minimum n that satisfies 1+2<sup>-n</sup>=1

<br/>

### **Compilation Method**

All files are compiled using GCC with the following input at command prompt. <br/>

File: get_eps.c

    gcc -o get_eps get_eps.c


File: machar.c

    gcc -o machar machar.c
